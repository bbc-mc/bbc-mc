### Things I've Built
#### AI & Creative Tools
- [sdweb-merge-block-weighted-gui](https://github.com/bbc-mc/sdweb-merge-block-weighted-gui)  
  Fine-grained model merging - control all 25 U-Net blocks independently.
- [sdweb-merge-board](https://github.com/bbc-mc/sdweb-merge-board)  
  Multi-step merge automation for when you need to experiment... a lot. Chain complex workflows effortlessly.
- [sdweb-eagle-pnginfo](https://github.com/bbc-mc/sdweb-eagle-pnginfo)  
  One-click image organization. Keep your metadata, save your sanity.

#### Legacy Fun
- Minecraft Mods - Some features made it to vanilla! 🎮

### How I Code
- Start with "what's annoying me today?" then fix it
- Keep it simple, make it fun to use  
- Learning by building, building by breaking things

Currently fascinated by: LLMs, fine-tuning, serverless AI deployments, creative workflow automation
